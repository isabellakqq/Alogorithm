'''
Return sends a specified value back to its caller whereas Yield can produce a sequence of values. 
We should use yield when we want to iterate over a sequence, but donâ€™t want to store the entire sequence in memory.
Yield are used in Python generators. A generator function is defined like a normal function, 
but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. 
If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.
